 <h2 id='section1'>Plot Overview</h2>
  <p>The game follows the story of mercenary Cloud Strife, who is hired by the eco-terrorist
  group AVALANCHE—led by Barret Wallace—to help fight the mega-corporation Shinra Electric Power Company, 
  who attempts to drain the planet's lifeblood as an energy source to further their profits. Apathetic 
  to the cause, Cloud initially fights for personal gain, and for the promise he made to childhood friend 
  Tifa Lockhart. Cloud eventually joins forces with many others to save the planet, which is threatened 
  by Shinra and Cloud's nemesis Sephiroth, and discovers a reason to fight for a cause other than his own.</p><br>

 <h2 id='section5'>Reviews</h2>
  <blockquote>
  Every aspect of the game is virtually flawless, from its movie inspired soundtrack, to the incredibly 
  life-like FMV, to the detailed battle and Materia systems, to the boatload of simplistic and addictive 
  mini-games. This is what RPG fans have been waiting for.
