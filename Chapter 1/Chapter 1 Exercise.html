<h2>Step-by-Step Method</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>Step 1: Gather all the listed ingredients.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic together in an
  oven over medium heat until it looks well browned</li>
  <li>Step 3: Add in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water -
  then stir it all in. Then, season with sugar, 2 tablespoons of parsley, basil, 1
  teaspoon of salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeda, and pepper. Simmer it while covered,
  then wait for 1 ½ hours while stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
  in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
  <li>Step 5: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
  parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
  <li>Step 6: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Step 7: To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
  baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
  Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese 
  slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
  cheese.</li>
  <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil:
  to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not 
  touch the cheese.</li>

  25 minutes.</li>
